I have chosen to represent stock data using a candlestick chart for the following reasons:

1 -Detailed Data Presentation: A candlestick chart provides comprehensive information about stock price movements, including open, close, high, and low prices within a specific time frame.

2. Clear Visualization: Candlestick charts offer a visually intuitive representation of stock data, with distinctive bullish and bearish candlestick shapes, making it easy for users to interpret.

3. Intraday Analysis: This chart type is valuable for intraday data, allowing users to identify patterns and trends that can influence their trading decisions.

4. Historical View: Users can track historical stock performance and analyze price fluctuations over time.
 
5. Customization Options: We offer customization options, allowing users to include additional indicators like moving averages and volume for a more in-depth analysis.

6. Useful for Technical Analysis: Traders and investors can apply technical analysis techniques to make informed decisions.

We believe that this choice of chart type will provide our customers with a valuable tool for understanding stock data and making more informed investment decisions.













# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
